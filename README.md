 ## 🤔 Context
An activity passed on by the programming class had the context of the game Zelda, in which the character Link explored Hyrule, discovering some paintings that resemble our current game of tic-tac-toe, so Link needed a tool to predict who would win such games.

_|x|o
_|_|_

_|_|_
o|_|_
x|_|_
```
## How to use:
Requirements:
- Python

>git clone https://github.com/ericlbarreto/tic-tac-toe-predict.git

Run the code and paste the input you want to predict, remembering to follow the structure of the game.
